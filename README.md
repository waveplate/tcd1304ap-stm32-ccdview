this is firmware for the stm32f401re that reads pixel data from the tcd1304ap linear ccd sensor and transmits it in realtime over rs232

> *note: this project is currently under development*

there is an included `ccdview.py` which visualises this data

this is an stm32cubeide project and uses the stm32f4 hardware abstraction layer
